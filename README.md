## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **vision-guided Cartesian robotic system** that autonomously detects objects using **YOLOv8** and positions a custom-built **2-axis Cartesian gantry** over the detected object.

A fixed overhead camera captures the workspace, YOLOv8 identifies the object's centroid, and the coordinates are transmitted to an **ESP32**. The controller converts the received coordinates into motor steps and simultaneously drives two NEMA17 stepper motors to accurately position the end-effector.

The project demonstrates the integration of **Computer Vision**, **Embedded Systems**, **Motion Control**, and **Mechanical Design** into a complete robotic automation system.
